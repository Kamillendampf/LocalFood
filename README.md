🥕 LocalFood

LocalFood is a platform that enables local food producers to sell their products directly to customers — without intermediaries. The goal is to reduce food waste and promote access to fresh, regional produce.
🔍 Overview

LocalFood categorizes products into two types:
🟠 TGTG (Too Good To Go)

Products that may be damaged or imperfect but are still safe to consume. These are sold at a reduced price to help minimize food waste.
🟢 Harvest Fresh

Freshly harvested, high-quality products that meet standard retail requirements and are sold at regular prices.
